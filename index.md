<!-- ## About Me -->

I am a  Master of Applied Science graduate from the University of Toronto, supervised by [Harry Ruda](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/ruda-h/) (Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering). My graduate research investigates real-world applications of machine learning and robotics, particularly in the development of automated, data-driven healthcare and agricultural tools. My master's thesis focused on the development of a multimodal system using micro/macro-scale optical imaging technologies for the quantification and optimization of crop health.

More broadly, I am interested in data fusion and distributed systems applied to critical problems such as monitoring climate change, optimizing infrastructure in cities, and diagnosing disease. 

I previously received my Bachlelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto, with a major in Robotics Engineering and a minor in Artificial Intelligence Engineering.
